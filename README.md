# epub-reader
A desktop app for EPub developed with Electron

## Build and Run
1. Install latest `node` and `npm`.
2. Install `node-gyp` first, and make sure all the build dependencies are installed. Failure of package `font-manager` could cause `electron` in an incorrect status. Currently the reader only supports Windows platform. You'd better install [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) first.
3. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` and have fun.
